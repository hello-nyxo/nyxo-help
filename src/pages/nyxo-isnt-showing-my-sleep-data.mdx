## Why isn't Nyxo showing my data?

Nyxo allows you to use your existing sleep tracker's data by importing it from Apple Health. However, sometimes there might be some problems with Nyxo reading that data. We have added instructions below on how to fix the most common issues. We are also in the process of adding device-specific instructions.",

## No access to Apple Health

In order to work using your existing sleep data, Nyxo requires a Read-access to Apple Health. When you first start using Nyxo, you're prompted to enable this access. Access to Apple Health can only be changed in the Health App.

## Nyxo is showing different information for last night than my tracker

Sometimes the sleep tracking information might differ between Nyxo, and your sleep trackers own app. This might be caused by Nyxo using a different tracking source, or because your sleep trackers save the data in a different format to Apple Health. Please ensure that you have chosen your primary sleep tracker as the source in the settings. You can change your sleep tracker by going to the Settings page and selecting the 'Select Tracking Source' section.
