We know looking at bright lights during the evening can delay your sleep cycle and keep you awake, so we added a night mode. The night mode makes the Nyxo app darker, so itâ€™s easier on your eyes at night.

To enable the night mode, go to **Settings** and scroll down to Switch theme. Click **Switch theme** and the night mode will be enabled.
