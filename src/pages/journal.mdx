# Adding Sleep Data
Inside the Journal tab, you can manually add your sleep data, if you donâ€™t have a health tracker (ie: FitBit, Google Health) integrated with the Nyxo app. The time you slept can be seen on the clock face on this tab.

You can browse your sleep data for previous nights by clicking on the dates at the top of the screen.

Note: If you have integrated your FitBit device, you can not manually add sleep data into the Nyxo app.
# Habits
You can also see all of your Active Habits and add new Habits [link to the Habits section].
# Notifications
On the Journal tab, you can see any Nyxo notifications that need your attention.
