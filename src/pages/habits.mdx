## What Are Habits?
With Nyxo Sleep Coaching, most of the Sleep Coaching lessons will end with a new Habit or two for you to adopt with the goal of helping you improve your sleep. Habits are a crucial part of getting the most from your Nyxo Sleep Coaching. We highly recommend you use them.

## Adding a New Habit
To add a new Habit, go to the Journal tab and scroll down until you see Active Habits. Click New Habit.

From there, you can add a new Habit for the morning, afternoon, or evening.
