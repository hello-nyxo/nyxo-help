Nyxo Sleep Coaching is structured into four weeks, each one of them focusing on a different part of good sleep. By connecting your sleep tracker to Nyxo, through the Nyxo app, we use your sleep data to personalize the coaching program to your unique needs. By examining your circadian rhythm, we can bring you personalized advice in the form of lessons, practices, and facilitated habit change.
